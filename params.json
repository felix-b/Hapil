{"name":"Happil","tagline":"A Reflection.Emit wrapper for dynamic implementation of interfaces and abstract classes, which just works and keeps its users happy.","body":"### Welcome to Happil.\r\nThis project is aimed to create a Reflection.Emit wrapper library, one that would precisely fit use cases of runtime type generation. We launched this project because we feel that existing alternatives don't fit that well.\r\n\r\n### Use Cases\r\n* Implementation: developers define interfaces, then you have to provide implementations of the interfaces at runtime.\r\n* Interception: you need to decorate objects with implementation of cross-cutting concerns.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n* RunSharp \r\n* FluentIL\r\n* Castle DynamicProxy\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
