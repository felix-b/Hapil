# Hapil, the CoI framework

Hello and thank you for your interest in the **Hapil** library.

## What is Hapil

Hapil is a back-end framework for the [Convention over Implementation](ConventionOverImplementation) principle

The principle states that:

* Whenever  multiple contracts are required to be implemented in a unified way, the implementation must be automated
* Implementation must be applied to a contract as a set of conventions.
    * A single convention can provide the complete implementation
    * Or, different aspects of implementation can be captured by multiple conventions; a combination of conventions can be chosen to produce the complete result.
* One should not give up a good design just because it requires repetitive implementation of user-defined contracts; there is now **Hapil** to rescue.
