Happil
======

Here we are building a Reflection.Emit wrapper library in C#.NET. We want a library which:

* Lets us implement interfaces and abstract classes at run-time.
* Lets us build from-scratch implementations with any members and code we may want.
* Lets us build decorators and interceptors.
* Lets us use generated types without any further Reflection. 
* Is lighweight, even in large applications with thousands of dynamic types.
* Makes it fun and easy to follow the happy path.
* Makes it hard to create an invalid program.
* Just works.
* Keeps its users happy.
