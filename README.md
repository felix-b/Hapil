Happil
======

Here we are building a **Reflection.Emit wrapper** library in **C#.NET**. We want a library which:

* Lets us **implement interfaces and abstract classes** at run-time.
* Lets us build **from-scratch implementations** with **any members and code** we may want.
* Lets us build **decorators** and **interceptors**.
* Lets us use generated types **without any further Reflection**. 
* Is **lightweight**, even in **large applications** with **thousands** of dynamic types.
* Makes it **fun and easy** to follow the **happy path**.
* Makes it hard to create an invalid program.
* **Just works**.
* Keeps its **users happy**.
